# epidemicmodel
Learning the basics of epidemic modelling via compartmental models in Python
I did this project under the supervision of Prof Raja Paul, IACS Kolkata in December 2021. Then it was mostly data visualisation for COVID-19, and general epidemic modelling. 
Currently, I am extending this project.
I will be regularly updating this space with new files, so keep an eye on it!
